\section{Longest Palindromic Substring}

    I solved this using dynamic programming.

    Basic solution is that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If str[i]==str[j], check whether str[i+1,j-1] is also palindrome.
        \item If not, the longest palindrome could be in str[i+1,j] or str[i,j+1].
    \end{enumerate}

    If bottom-up, each cell dp[i][j] indicates whether str[i,j] is 
    a palindrome. Deciding whether str[i,j] is palindrome needs 
    deciding whether str[i+1,j+1] is palindrome first.

\section{Container With most Water}

    Given an array of height.

    Find min(height[i],height[j])*(j-i) such that is maximum.
    
\section{Course Schedule}

    There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, 
    labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. 
    You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] 
    indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

    Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
